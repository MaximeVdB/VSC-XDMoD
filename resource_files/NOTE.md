## Notes regarding the resource files
1) There should always be a "resource" match in between resources in `resources.json` and `resource_specs.json`.
2) The "start-date" should be specified in the YYYY-MM-DD format. The "end-date" is optional and should only be added if a resource is no longer opperational.
3) Valid "resource-types" include "KU Leuven", "UAntwerpen", "UGent" & "VUB".
